# ABC-Boilerplate
!! This is currently not working due to some deno changes in the way `import` works in type script, it will be updated eventually to support whatever Deno decides, but since we need `unstable` to use some features, this cannot be updated until Deno decides if this feature goes to production and the other libraries update !!

Boilerplate for Deno ABC

deno run --allow-net --unstable --allow-env --allow-read index.ts


Features: 

User authentication with JWT.

Basic middleware examples.

Simple and basic folder structure to build off of. 

Fully typescript.

Deno.


-- You probably shouldn't use this for anything you really care about... A lot of requirements for various parts of a web application are behind Deno's unstable flag...
